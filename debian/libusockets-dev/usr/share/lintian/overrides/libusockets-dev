# Static library compiled with LTO (-flto flag) contains code in
# intermediate representation format (GIMPLE/LLVM bitcode) which is
# resolved at link time when building final applications.
#
# Additionally, some object files (gcd.o, epoll_kqueue.o, io_*.o, quic.o)
# are intentionally empty due to conditional compilation:
# - gcd.o: macOS-only (Grand Central Dispatch), unused on Linux
# - epoll_kqueue.o: not used when WITH_LIBUV=1 (libuv replaces epoll)
# - io_*.o: io_uring support not enabled (no WITH_IO_URING flag)
# - quic.o: QUIC protocol implementation not yet complete
#
# The library is fully functional, as verified by symbol analysis:
# $ nm /usr/lib/*/libuSockets.a | grep ' T ' shows 100+ function symbols
# including bsd_*, us_socket_*, us_loop_*, ssl_* functions.
